# “Robot or Not” — Sample code files for [<cite>Responsive Web Design</cite>](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design)

Hello there, lovely reader!

This is the repository for the “ROBOT…OR NOT?” demo site ([http://responsivewebdesign.com/robot/](http://responsivewebdesign.com/robot/)), an example site used in [Ethan Marcotte](http://ethanmarcotte.com/)’s <cite>[Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design)</cite>. Please do come in, download [the latest files](https://gitlab.com/beep/rwd-samplefiles/repository/archive.zip), and poke around.

As you do, though, there are two things I'd ask you keep in mind:

1. This stylesheet reflects the structure of the book: starting from a desktop-centric layout, and using media queries to size it up *and* down from that point. As I say in Chapter 5 of the book, the more responsible, *accessible* approach would be to start from a linear, small screen-friendly layout, and use `min-width` queries to scale *up* from that point.
2. Since this is a demo site, there are a number of production-ready optimizations that haven’t been made. (Concatenated files, conditionally loaded JavaScript, and so on.) In fact, there are very few “best practices” to be found herein! Think of these files as demonstrating a set of layout principles: no more—and no less!—than that.

With all that said: dive on in! And thanks _so much_ for reading my book!
